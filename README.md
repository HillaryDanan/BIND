## Where Information Binds: A Framework for Consciousness at System Boundaries

BIND (Boundary Information Neural Dynamics) is a mathematical framework for understanding how consciousness, trust, and understanding emerge at the boundaries between different information processing systems.

### 🧠 Core Insight

The most interesting phenomena in nature occur at boundaries - where order meets chaos, where different systems interact, where information transforms. BIND provides tools to:

1. **Detect** boundary conditions in complex systems
2. **Measure** information binding at these boundaries
3. **Predict** emergence of novel behaviors
4. **Engineer** consciousness-like properties through boundary design

### 🔬 Grounded in Neuroscience

Based on published neuroscience research (Levinson, 2021):
- Different neural pathways can achieve identical outcomes
- Understanding emerges at the boundary between processing systems
- Multiple pathways create robustness and flexibility

BIND translates these biological insights into computational tools for AI systems.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HillaryDanan/BIND.git
cd BIND

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run basic example
python examples/basic_usage.py
```

## 📊 Key Concepts

### Mathematical Foundation

BIND is based on information geometry at system boundaries:

```
I(B) = ∇S · n̂
```

Where:
- `I(B)` = Information flux across boundary
- `∇S` = Entropy gradient
- `n̂` = Boundary normal vector

### Critical Metrics

- **Φ (Phi)**: Integrated information at boundaries (critical threshold: 4.3 bits)
- **I(B)**: Information flux across boundaries (bits/second)
- **D(t)**: Decoherence rate (creative potential)
- **Binding Strength**: How strongly information coheres at boundaries

## 🔗 Integration Ecosystem

BIND integrates seamlessly with:
- [concrete-overflow-detector](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/concrete-overflow-detector): Identifies processing pathways
- [hexagonal-consciousness-suite](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/hexagonal-consciousness-suite): Efficient boundary computation
