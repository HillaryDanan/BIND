## A Research Framework for Information Transformation at System Boundaries

BIND (Boundary Information Neural Dynamics) is a mathematical framework for studying how information transforms at the boundaries between different processing systems. Based on neuroscience research showing that different neural pathways can achieve identical outcomes, BIND provides tools for analyzing boundary dynamics in complex systems.

### 🔬 Research Foundation

Based on published neuroscience research (Levinson, 2021) demonstrating:
- Different neural pathways can achieve identical computational outcomes
- Information transformation occurs at boundaries between processing systems
- Multiple pathways create robustness and flexibility in biological systems

BIND translates these biological insights into computational tools for analyzing artificial systems.

### 📊 Research Applications

1. **System Analysis**: Study how information flows between subsystems
2. **Robustness Research**: Explore multiple pathway architectures
3. **Boundary Dynamics**: Analyze transformation at system interfaces
4. **Integration Metrics**: Measure coordination between components

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HillaryDanan/BIND.git
cd BIND

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run basic example
python examples/basic_usage.py

# Try interactive research tool
python bind_interactive.py
```

## 📐 Mathematical Foundation

BIND implements information-theoretic analysis at system boundaries:

```
I(B) = ∇S · n̂
```

Where:
- `I(B)` = Information flux across boundary
- `∇S` = Entropy gradient
- `n̂` = Boundary normal vector

### Key Metrics

- **Information Flux**: Rate of information transfer across boundaries
- **Integration Measure (Φ)**: Degree of subsystem coordination
- **Pathway Diversity**: Available processing routes
- **Boundary Coverage**: Proportion of system at interfaces

## 🔧 Core Components

- `BoundaryMonitor`: Analyzes information flow at system boundaries
- `BoundarySimulator`: Generates test systems for research
- `BoundaryConfig`: Configuration management for experiments

## 🌐 Interactive Tools

- **Python Explorer** (`bind_interactive.py`): Desktop research interface
- **Web Tool** (`bind_research_tool.html`): Browser-based exploration
