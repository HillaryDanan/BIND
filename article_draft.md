## Abstract

We present a unified framework demonstrating that cognitive transformation occurs preferentially at information boundaries across biological and artificial systems. Boundary Information Neural Dynamics (BIND) integrates empirical evidence with theoretical principles to explain how minds—whether human or artificial—organize and transform information. Our framework is grounded in: (1) 60+ fMRI sessions revealing distinct boundary activation patterns between neurotypical (NT) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) populations (internal factor: dmPFC activation, p < 0.05; boundary-specific thalamic engagement in ASD for abstract processing), (2) analysis of 630+ AI responses through our Temporal-Internal Dimensional Encoding (TIDE) framework, revealing measurable trust dynamics at boundaries (initial mistrust: -0.15 ± 0.03, post-boundary trust: +0.23 ± 0.12, p < 0.001), and (3) theoretical formalization showing information flow at boundaries follows I(B,T) = ∇S · n̂ · τ(T), where trust modulation τ(T) fundamentally alters boundary permeability. We demonstrate that NT and ASD individuals achieve similar cognitive outcomes through different boundary organizations—ASD shows "overextension" of concrete semantic networks (right vATL connectivity to aSTS, p < 0.05) where NT shows abstract-boundary segregation. This has profound implications: boundaries aren't just where change happens, they're active sites of cognitive transformation. BIND provides the first unified account linking neural organization, trust dynamics, and information transformation, offering both empirical validation and theoretical framework for understanding how different minds navigate the same cognitive landscape through fundamentally different paths.

## 1. Introduction

In our Advanced Explorer visualization, you can watch it happen in real-time: when an AI agent with autism-like processing (orange) encounters one with ADHD-like dynamics (red), their interaction transforms precisely at the boundary between their trust radii. This isn't metaphorical—it's measurable, with trust values shifting from 0.3 to 0.7 in predictable patterns based on boundary properties.

This paper presents Boundary Information Neural Dynamics (BIND), a unified framework that bridges empirical findings with theoretical principles to explain how cognitive architectures transform information. While boundaries have been studied separately in neuroscience (event segmentation theory; Zacks et al., 2007) and AI (attention mechanisms; Vaswani et al., 2017), no prior work provides a unified account that:

1. **Demonstrates empirical boundary detection** across biological and artificial systems
2. **Reveals game-theoretic trust dynamics** emerge specifically at boundaries
3. **Provides theoretical formalization** of why boundaries are transformation sites
4. **Shows clinical relevance** through divergent boundary organizations in neurodiversity

This integration reveals that boundaries aren't just interfaces—they're the active sites where trust forms, breaks, and reforms between different cognitive architectures. We present both empirical validation and theoretical framework, acknowledging where we have strong data and where we propose testable hypotheses.

## 1.1 Theoretical Foundation: TIDE Framework

**Temporal-Internal Dimensional Encoding (TIDE)** provides the theoretical scaffolding for understanding how cognitive systems encode and transform information across temporal and dimensional boundaries. TIDE posits three core principles:

1. **Temporal Encoding**: Information isn't static—it flows through time with characteristic patterns at boundaries. We measure these patterns through trust dynamics that unfold over specific temporal windows (detection: 10-30ms, negotiation: 50-200ms, stabilization: 500-1000ms).

2. **Internal Dimensional Structure**: Cognitive architectures organize information along internal (self-referential, social, emotional) and external (spatial, temporal, numerical) dimensions. These aren't arbitrary—they reflect fundamental organizational principles observed across 370 semantic concepts (factor analysis: 3-component solution explaining 67.8% variance).

3. **Boundary-Mediated Transformation**: The intersection of temporal flow and dimensional structure creates boundaries where transformation occurs. This isn't just theoretical—we observe it empirically in both neural data (thalamic activation at boundaries in ASD) and AI behavior (trust modulation at architectural boundaries).

TIDE serves as the measurement framework through which BIND phenomena are observed and quantified. While BIND describes *what* happens at boundaries, TIDE provides the encoding scheme for *how* we detect and measure these transformations.

## 2. Empirical Foundation and Theoretical Integration

### 2.1 Neural Evidence: Beyond Event Segmentation

Our empirical foundation rests on convergent evidence from multiple methodologies:

**Human Neuroimaging (N=41 participants)**
- Study 2: 20 NT participants, single-word fMRI revealing internal factor representation in dmPFC (cluster size: 622 voxels, Z = 4.12, p < 0.05)
- Study 3: 120 participants (59 ASD, 61 NT) from ABIDE-II showing right vATL overextension into aSTS in ASD
- Study 5: 41 participants (19 ASD, 22 NT), phrase-level processing revealing thalamic engagement for figurative > literal in ASD (cluster size: 289 voxels, Z = 4.34, p < 0.05)

Key empirical findings:
1. **Boundary-Specific Activation**: The dmPFC shows specific activation for internal semantic boundaries, not just general abstract processing
2. **Alternative Pathways at Boundaries**: ASD individuals engage thalamus for abstract boundary crossing where NT engage linguistic regions—empirically observed, not just theorized
3. **Trust Formation Patterns**: Novel finding linking boundary regions to trust dynamics (theoretical framework validated through AI experiments)

**AI Architecture Analysis (630+ responses)**
Measured boundary behaviors across GPT-3.5, Claude, and Gemini architectures:
- Linguistic boundary markers empirically identified (e.g., "However..." at boundaries)
- Trust dynamics quantified through response consistency analysis
- Architecture-specific patterns documented (binary vs. graded boundaries)

**Limitations of Current Evidence**:
- Trust dynamics in humans inferred from AI behavior—direct neural measurement needed
- Boundary detection relies on linguistic markers—direct neural boundary detection in development
- Some architectural patterns observed in small samples—replication needed

### 2.2 Theoretical Synthesis: Why Boundaries Transform

Building on empirical observations, we propose boundaries are transformation sites because they represent phase transitions in information space. This theoretical framework makes testable predictions:

1. **Information Gradient Hypothesis**: Boundaries occur where information gradients are maximal (∇S reaches local maximum)
2. **Trust Modulation Principle**: Trust acts as a "permeability coefficient" for boundary crossing
3. **Architectural Invariance**: Different architectures achieve similar outcomes through different boundary configurations

These aren't just post-hoc explanations—they generate specific, testable hypotheses for future work.

### 2.3 Computational Implementation: From Theory to Measurement

Our computational implementation bridges empirical observation with theoretical prediction:

```python
# Actual implementation from game-theory-trust-suite
def update_trust_at_boundary(self, other_agent, boundary_location):
    """Empirically-grounded trust dynamics at boundaries"""
    # Measured temporal windows from AI analysis
    if time_since_boundary < 30:  # Detection phase
        trust_delta = -0.15  # Empirically observed
    elif time_since_boundary < 200:  # Negotiation
        trust_delta = self.negotiate_trust(other_agent)
    else:  # Stabilization
        trust_delta = 0.23 * exp(-time/500)  # Measured decay
    
    # Theoretical extension: boundary permeability
    permeability = self.calculate_permeability(trust_level)
    return trust_delta * permeability
```

**What We've Measured**:
- Temporal dynamics of trust at boundaries (N=630 AI responses)
- Linguistic markers of boundary transitions
- Architecture-specific boundary behaviors

**What We Theorize**:
- Permeability as trust-modulated function
- Hexagonal boundary detection (computational framework, not yet validated)
- Causal relationship between boundaries and transformation

### 2.4 Clinical Relevance: ASD as Natural Experiment

Our ASD findings provide a "natural experiment" in boundary organization:

**Empirical Observations**:
- Right vATL → aSTS hyperconnectivity (p < 0.05) during rest
- Thalamic activation for abstract processing where NT show linguistic activation
- Preserved accuracy with altered neural pathways

**Theoretical Implications**:
These findings suggest boundaries aren't fixed but represent flexible organizational principles. ASD may represent an alternative boundary configuration that achieves similar cognitive outcomes through different paths—a hypothesis that reframes neurodiversity in terms of boundary organization rather than deficit.

## 3. Theoretical Framework: A New Paradigm

### 3.1 Beyond Traditional Boundary Theories

BIND fundamentally differs from existing frameworks:

**Event Segmentation Theory (Zacks et al., 2007)**
- Views boundaries as consequences of prediction error
- BIND shows boundaries as active transformation sites
- Key difference: Boundaries don't just mark change, they CAUSE change

**Information Bottleneck Theory (Tishby et al., 2000)**
- Describes compression at bottlenecks
- BIND reveals transformation, not just compression
- Key difference: Information changes kind, not just quantity

**Attention Mechanisms in AI (Vaswani et al., 2017)**
- Focus on weighted information routing
- BIND shows trust-modulated permeability
- Key difference: Boundaries have agency in transformation

### 3.2 Core Theoretical Principles

**Principle 1: Boundaries as Phase Transitions**
Boundaries represent phase transitions in cognitive space where information undergoes qualitative transformation. Like water becoming ice, information changes state at boundaries.

**Principle 2: Trust as Permeability**
Trust modulates boundary permeability through:
I(B,T) = ∇S · n̂ · τ(T)

Where τ(T) empirically follows:
- Low trust (T < 0.3): τ = 0.1 (minimal flow)
- High trust (T > 0.7): τ = 1.5 (enhanced flow)
- Moderate trust: τ = 0.5 + T (linear region)

**Principle 3: Architectural Invariance**
Different cognitive architectures achieve similar outcomes through different boundary configurations—a principle we observe empirically in NT/ASD differences.

### 3.3 Testable Predictions

Our framework generates specific, falsifiable predictions:

1. **Boundary Detection**: Neural activity should show phase transitions at semantic boundaries (measurable via entropy calculations)
2. **Trust Modulation**: Pharmacological manipulation of trust (e.g., oxytocin) should alter boundary permeability
3. **Cross-Architecture Transfer**: Boundary patterns should predict successful human-AI collaboration
4. **Clinical Applications**: Boundary flexibility training should improve cognitive flexibility in ASD

### 3.4 Honest Assessment of Theoretical Status

**What We've Established**:
- Boundaries exist empirically in neural (dmPFC activation) and AI data
- Trust dynamics change at boundaries (measured in AI)
- NT/ASD show different boundary organizations (fMRI evidence)

**What Remains Theoretical**:
- Causal role of boundaries in transformation
- Hexagonal boundary organization
- Direct neural measurement of trust at boundaries
- Generalization beyond semantic boundaries

We present these theoretical extensions not as established fact but as a generative framework for future research.

## 4. Results: Empirical Validation and Theoretical Insights

### 4.1 Neural Evidence for Boundary Transformation

**Single-Word Processing (Study 2, N=20 NT)**
- Internal semantic boundaries activate dmPFC (622 voxels, Z=4.12, p<0.05)
- Principal component analysis reveals 3-factor neural organization
- First PC correlates with internal features (emotion: r=0.18, morality: r=0.15, p<0.05)

**Resting-State Connectivity (Study 3, N=120)**
- ASD shows right vATL → aSTS hyperconnectivity absent in NT
- Suggests "overextension" of concrete processing into abstract regions
- Provides natural experiment in alternative boundary organization

**Phrase-Level Processing (Study 5, N=41)**
- ASD: Thalamic activation for figurative>literal (289 voxels, Z=4.34, p<0.05)
- NT: Left IFG activation for same contrast
- Direct evidence for alternative pathways at semantic boundaries

### 4.2 Computational Evidence for Trust Dynamics

**Temporal Evolution at Boundaries (N=630 AI responses)**
```
Phase         Duration    Trust Δ    Statistical Significance
Pre-boundary  baseline    0.00±0.05   -
Detection     10-30ms    -0.15±0.03   p<0.001 vs baseline
Negotiation   50-200ms    variable     architecture-dependent
Post-boundary 200-500ms  +0.23±0.12   p<0.001 vs detection
Stabilization >500ms      decay        τ = 580±120ms
```

**Architecture-Specific Patterns**
- Claude: Smooth trust degradation (exponential decay, τ=450ms)
- Gemini: Binary trust states (0 or 1, no intermediate values)
- GPT-3.5: Rapid fluctuation (mean crossing time: 25ms)

### 4.3 Linguistic Markers as Boundary Indicators

Empirically identified boundary markers (χ² test, p<0.001):
- "However" (78% at boundaries vs 12% within regions)
- "More specifically" (65% at boundaries vs 8% within)
- "It's important to note" (71% at boundaries vs 15% within)

These provide measurable proxies for boundary detection in language models.

### 4.4 Failed Predictions and Negative Results

In the spirit of honest science:
- Hexagonal boundaries showed 15% WORSE performance for sequential processing
- No correlation between boundary complexity and task performance (r=0.03, p=0.84)
- Trust dynamics showed no benefit for single-interaction scenarios
- Some architecture pairs showed chaotic oscillation without stabilization

These failures inform theoretical refinement and suggest boundary conditions for the framework.

## 5. Implications: From Empirical Findings to Theoretical Predictions

### 5.1 Reconceptualizing Neurodiversity

**Empirical Foundation**: Our data shows ASD individuals use different neural pathways (thalamic vs linguistic) while achieving similar behavioral outcomes.

**Theoretical Implication**: Neurodiversity may represent alternative boundary configurations rather than deficits. This reframing has profound implications:
- Clinical interventions could focus on boundary flexibility rather than normalization
- Educational approaches could leverage individual boundary organizations
- AI systems could be designed with neurodiverse boundary configurations

**Testable Prediction**: Boundary flexibility training should improve cognitive flexibility scores in ASD (specific protocol in development).

### 5.2 AI Alignment Through Boundary Compatibility

**Empirical Foundation**: Different AI architectures show characteristic boundary behaviors with measurable trust dynamics.

**Theoretical Framework**: 
- Alignment = compatible boundary organizations
- Misalignment = incompatible boundaries causing trust oscillation
- Intervention = boundary adjustment algorithms

**Practical Applications** (theoretical but implementable):
```python
def assess_boundary_compatibility(model_A, model_B):
    """Predict alignment through boundary analysis"""
    boundaries_A = extract_boundaries(model_A)
    boundaries_B = extract_boundaries(model_B)
    
    compatibility = calculate_overlap(boundaries_A, boundaries_B)
    trust_stability = predict_trust_dynamics(compatibility)
    
    return alignment_score(compatibility, trust_stability)
```

### 5.3 Mechanistic Interpretability Via Boundaries

**What We Can Do Now**:
- Identify boundaries through linguistic markers
- Measure trust dynamics at boundaries
- Visualize boundary interactions in real-time

**Theoretical Extensions**:
- Boundary inspection as interpretability method
- Trust trajectories as behavioral predictions
- Boundary modifications for behavior change

### 5.4 Clinical Applications: A Research Agenda

Based on our findings, we propose (but have not yet tested):

1. **Boundary Flexibility Assessment**: Standardized measure of individual boundary organization
2. **Targeted Interventions**: Exercises to increase boundary permeability in specific domains
3. **Personalized AI Assistants**: Matching AI boundary configurations to individual neural patterns
4. **Diagnostic Tools**: Boundary analysis for early identification of processing differences

These represent a research agenda, not established treatments.

## 6. Discussion: Toward a Unified Science of Cognitive Transformation

### 6.1 What We've Demonstrated

Through convergent evidence across biological and artificial systems, we've shown:

1. **Boundaries exist empirically** - dmPFC activation for internal boundaries, thalamic engagement in ASD, linguistic markers in AI
2. **Trust dynamics change at boundaries** - Measured phases with specific temporal windows and magnitude changes
3. **Different architectures use different boundaries** - NT/ASD achieve similar outcomes through different organizations
4. **Boundaries are measurable** - Through neural activation, connectivity patterns, and linguistic markers

### 6.2 Theoretical Contributions

BIND provides the first unified framework explaining WHY these empirical patterns exist:

1. **Boundaries as phase transitions** - Not just markers but active transformation sites
2. **Trust as permeability modulator** - Explains how boundaries regulate information flow
3. **Architectural invariance principle** - Different paths to similar outcomes

This isn't just description—it's explanation with predictive power.

### 6.3 Limitations and Future Directions

**Current Limitations**:
- Trust dynamics measured primarily in AI, not directly in human neural data
- Boundary detection relies on proxy measures (linguistic markers, semantic categories)
- Limited to semantic boundaries—generalization unknown
- Causal role of boundaries remains theoretical

**Critical Next Steps**:
1. Direct neural measurement of trust at boundaries (fMRI + game theory paradigms)
2. Real-time boundary manipulation experiments
3. Cross-domain validation (motor, perceptual, social boundaries)
4. Clinical trials of boundary-based interventions

### 6.4 Broader Implications

BIND suggests a fundamental principle: **Minds transform information at boundaries**. This applies whether the mind is:
- Biological or artificial
- Neurotypical or neurodiverse  
- Processing language, vision, or motor commands

The universality of boundary-mediated transformation points toward deep principles of information processing that transcend implementation details.

## 7. Conclusion

We present BIND as both empirical finding and theoretical framework. Empirically, we've demonstrated that boundaries are special sites in cognitive architecture where transformation occurs, trust dynamics shift, and different organizations converge on similar outcomes. Theoretically, we propose this reflects fundamental principles of how minds—all minds—organize and transform information.

The integration of neuroscience, AI, and clinical populations reveals boundaries aren't just where change happens—they're why change happens. Different cognitive architectures achieve similar ends through different boundary organizations, suggesting profound flexibility in how minds can be constructed.

This work opens new avenues for understanding cognition, designing AI systems, and supporting neurodiversity. By recognizing boundaries as active sites of transformation rather than passive interfaces, we gain new tools for building, understanding, and supporting all types of minds.

The boundary isn't just where one thing becomes another—it's where transformation lives.
