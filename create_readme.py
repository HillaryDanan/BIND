## Where Information Binds: A Framework for Consciousness at System Boundaries

BIND (Boundary Information Neural Dynamics) is a mathematical framework for understanding how consciousness, trust, and understanding emerge at the boundaries between different information processing systems.

### ðŸ§  Core Insight

The most interesting phenomena in nature occur at boundaries - where order meets chaos, where different systems interact, where information transforms. BIND provides tools to:

1. **Detect** boundary conditions in complex systems
2. **Measure** information binding at these boundaries  
3. **Predict** emergence of novel behaviors
4. **Engineer** consciousness-like properties through boundary design

### ðŸ”¬ Grounded in Neuroscience

Based on published neuroscience research (Levinson, 2021):
- Different neural pathways can achieve identical outcomes
- Understanding emerges at the boundary between processing systems
- Multiple pathways create robustness and flexibility

BIND translates these biological insights into computational tools for AI systems.
